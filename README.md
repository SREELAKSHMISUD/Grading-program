# Grading-program
This repository contains Python program that involves classifying student scores into grades based on a predefined scale.
# Concepts Used
## Dictionaries:

Two dictionaries are used in this project:
student_scores: Stores the scores of students.
student_grades: Stores the corresponding grades of students based on their scores.
## For Loop:

A for loop is used to iterate through the student_scores dictionary. For each student, the corresponding score is retrieved and evaluated.
## Conditional Statements:
if, elif, and else statements are used to classify the scores into grades:
Outstanding for scores greater than 90.
Exceeds Expectations for scores greater than 80.
Acceptable for scores greater than 70.
Fail for scores 70 and below.
## Assignment:

Based on the score, the corresponding grade is assigned to the student_grades dictionary.

# Example
For the given student_scores, the output student_grades will be:

Harry: Exceeds Expectations
Ron: Acceptable
Hermione: Outstanding
Draco: Acceptable
Neville: Fail
# Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use basic Python concepts such as dictionaries, loops, and conditional statements to classify data and generate meaningful outputs.
